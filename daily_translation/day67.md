#### my answer

- it's hard to not meet some people who are diffcult to get along with in our life time .
- take some time to think and find those things which make you angry.
- you'll be innevitable once you know your bottom line.
- those who are not easy to get along with like to drag you into arguments.
- 如果你什么也不做，对话就会继续原地打转。
