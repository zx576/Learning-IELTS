#### questions

1.      长期的恋情和短暂的约会大不相同。

2.      即便这段恋情以糟糕的方式结束，想要找人取代他/她的位置依然不容易。    

3.      所以那些过去有过长期恋情的人保持单身就不足为奇了。
4.      不管有没有道理，他们似乎就是找不到人来替代曾经那个人的位置

5.      the majority of people who are single are not single because they honestly and truly choose to be that way.

- 大部分单身的人之所以还单着，并不是因为他们发自内心地愿意选择这种生活方式。
