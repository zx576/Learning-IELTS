1.      结果表明，男女对待异性友谊的感受存在巨大的性别差异。 

2.      而这个问题依然没有得到解答

3.      因为一般来说女性不会被男性朋友所吸引。

4.      男性还更愿意让这种错觉下的相互吸引继续下去。

5.      But if we all thought like men, we’d probably be facing a serious overpopulation crisis.

#### my answers

- the result suggests that there are great differences between men and women treating opposite sex
- however, the question remains no answer
- generally speaking, female won't be attracted by male friends.
- men would perfer to sustain the wrong feeling of attracting each other.
- 如果我们都想男人一样思考，我们可能会面临过人口危机。


#### reference

- the results suggest large gender differences in how men and women experience opposite-sex friendships

- still, the question remains unanwsered.
- because females generally were not attracted to their male friends.
- men were also willing to act on this misstakenly perceived mutual attraction.
- 但是如果我们都想男性一样思考，我们恐怕要面对严重的人口过剩危机了。
